    <h4>
      "Glacier Capital" does not exist.
    </h4>
    <div
      className="selftext"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={
        Object {
          "__html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\\"md\\"><p>My friends, in all the mocking of Glacier Capital shorting GME today, we forgot to ask the most important question: do they actually exist? Bloomberg has a <a href=\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/566411Z:US\\">profile</a> of them, if you can call it that, claiming they were founded 3/14/05, but outside of this I can find no evidence that they existed until recently. No article mentions, no chest puffing PR, nothing but their linkedIn pages and their website.</p>

<p>&quot;Glacier Capital&quot; on their <a href=\\"http://glaciercapital.lu/\\">potentially insecure website</a> lists an address of record of <a href=\\"https://imgur.com/XyuT7S3\\">44 Boulevard de Verdun, L-2670 Luxembourg.</a> Now I don&#39;t know about you, but to me, that looks like an apartment building, not a multimillion dollar hedge fund. </p>

<p>So, I called &quot;Glacier.&quot; As we have previously observed, Melvin Capital doesn&#39;t even answer the phone anymore. Citadel at least still has the automated system pick up the phone. But in the case of &quot;Glacier Capital&quot; there is no automated system. Instead, we appear to be calling a personal cell phone, with the voice mailbox of &quot;Alex Larsen.&quot; Don&#39;t believe me? Call yourself. &quot;Glacier Capital&#39;s&quot; public phone number is +352 661 932 584. If you&#39;re in the US or Canada, you&#39;ll have to dial a 011 first to get into the international switching system.</p>

<p>I challenge anyone to prove Glacier Capital exists.</p>

<p>TL;DR &quot;Glacier Capital&quot; is FUD, they don&#39;t exist except on paper.</p>

<p>Edit: One more point of evidence in favor of this being a personal cell phone: If you call once, it goes straight to voicemail, but if you immediately call back it rings several times before going to voicemail. Android has a setting to allow calls to punch through &quot;Do not disturb&quot; mode if the same person calls twice in 5 minutes, which may be exactly what&#39;s happening here.</p>

<p>Edit PS: Credit to <a href=\\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/new7b6/check_out_glacier_capitals_head_office_no/\\">this post</a> for inspiring this investigation.</p>

<p>Edit 2: As <a href=\\"/u/mrperson221\\">u/mrperson221</a> said, why would a fund publicly advertise opening a new short position, especially in a stock that has been so volatile and known for retailers jumping on the bandwagon to crush short sellers? It paints a giant target on them. &quot;Glacier Capital&quot; is 100% FUD.</p>

<p>Edit 3: As some have commented, the owner of that cell phone seems to have turned it off or changed the settings, as the second call in a row is no longer punching through and ringing.</p>

<p>Edit 4: It appears the google image results may just be a google error since the searched picture doesn&#39;t seem to appear on the searched pages. I have no idea why they&#39;re showing up as matches or why similar results are not shown when searching the pictures of the other members of their staff.</p>

<p>Edit 5: To be clear, I do not mean to imply that there is no such legal entity as Glacier Capital. There are <a href=\\"https://www.lbr.lu/mjrcs/jsp/DisplayConsultDetailCompanyActionNotSecured.action?time=1621313108273&amp;CURRENT_TIMESTAMP_ID=1621313090005#null\\">public records</a> that show that such an entity does exist. What I am doubting is whether they are actually what they claim to be, an independent investment company, or whether they are a facade for some other entity.</p>

<p>Edit 6: Glacier Capital&#39;s website is not using https, so maybe save yourself the click unless you have to and clear your cookies afterward.</p>
